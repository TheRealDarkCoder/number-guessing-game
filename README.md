### Customizable Number guessing game in Python 3

This is a quick project to make a number guessing game with Python 3. The user can play in 3 difficulties where the computer generates a random number (integer) (using the `random` module) and the user has to guess the number within a few chances. THe script will also let the user know whether the user's guess is higher or lower than the chosen integer. 

The script also supports a "custom difficulty" setting where the user can set up their own configuration of range of numbers where to choose the random number from, as well as number of guesses avaialble to the user.
